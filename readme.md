# Building the code
To build the code you need to download and install the Kinect SDK which can be found at http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/kinectforwindowsdev/Downloads.aspx

If the `Microsoft.Kinect.dll` could not be found by Visual Studio, have a look at `C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Kinect\v1.7\Assemblies\Microsoft.Kinect.dll`

#Using the application
You can switch to the "move-mouse"-mode by moving your right hand towards the kinect sensor. You can then move the mouse by moving your hand. To left the "move-mouse"-mode just take back the hand.

You can hold down the left mouse button, by moving your left hand toward the kinect sensor. To stop holding down the mouse button take back your hand.
